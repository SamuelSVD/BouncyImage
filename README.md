# BouncyImage
This small project allows someone to add the HTML file as a source to OBS and have an image bouncing across the screen, similar to the DVD logo on old DVD players.

# Usage

The file bouncy-photo.html is what is used as the web element.

Edit the file and update the list of images at the top to point to whichever images you would like. In the example, "memes/meme1.jpg", etc. are the photos being used.

The photo should be a web link to an image or a relative filepath to the location of the file in your computer.

You can also change the following:

`speed` : change how fast the image moves on the screen

`interval` : change how frequent the position of the image is updated

`maxSize` : change the maximum width or height of the image bouncing around


# Example

NOTE:
It is smooth when running. The gif adds some jumpiness.
